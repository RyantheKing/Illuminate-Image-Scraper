# Illuminate-Image-Scraper
A image scalper demonstrating part of a now-fixed major security flaw in the Illuminate testing software's system.

Uploaded as demonstration of the security vulnerability now that it has been fixed. Allowed early access to test questions and answer choices by scraping images past the most recent test sequentially.

Example of images accessed that should be private (Sequentially stored images for 4 multiple choice answers circled):
